## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### What I learned

This project served to introduce me to the world of React in a practical way. I put special emphasis on consolidating and expanding the basic concepts and principles of React.

For the styling of the components I decided to use CSS Modules. This allowed me to give each component its own specific style without the risk of influencing other components with this styling.

I made sure to divide the app into as many logical and useful components as possible to test the general workflow and the work with many different components.

To provide the app with additional dynamic and to practice working with third party packages, I decided to provide drag and drop functionality using [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

All in all, I learned many things while programming this todo app and was able to consolidate and further expand my knowledge regarding React.
